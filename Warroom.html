<h1> <center> The War Room </center> </h1>
<h2> <center> My dear grandchild, it is good to see you've arrived. <br>
              Below, you can read the truth about Ravensburger's treachery. <br>
              I hope it will inspire you to pick up where I have left off. <br> </center> </h2>
         <div id="txt">     
<p> <center> Max J kobbert has been a liar his whole life. If you go to his personal 
webpage and look at how almost every word he says begins with a K or a T, you know he's trying to communicate something to me
I hope you will be able to find out what this is. SInce I cannot really believe that he has the decency to tell me himsefl.
When we worked on Labyrinth he would also look down his glasses at me when I made suggestions. Professor we used to call him,
until he turned into a huge dick. Into a pool of water I felt like i needed to throw myself.
While I may not be the smartest man on earth, I know when I am being screwed with, and I can tell you wholeheartedly how bad they 
treated me. Even though I found nothing to showcase for it, all I ever wanted was to make better games.
But all of these hacks that came in from the cold couldn't even place a hat on a rack without having instructions told to them.
Let me tell you, Although I might look like a fine guy, you owonldn't believe what they've put me through. Everybody let me be when
Luck &  SEnse fucked awayw. NO one tried to pick it up. As soon as we shit the bed I could smell them Ravensburger cockcusckers trying
to gain our ground. THey didn't even understand what I was building. Multimedia, that was a buzzword back then, and I knew It would become
a great hit. And wasn't i right?! Now everybody looks to their tv-screens away from each other to play games. I just donøt understand
how this momentum can cause suchc momentous bullshit. While I felt like flying away like a <a href="translate1.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:white;"> BIRD </a>, I wouldn't even dream of leaving my employees
behind, but they left me. ALl of them at Luck & Sense wanted it  to fail. I couldnt wsee that now but boy oh boy how they wre
licking their claws and waiting to pounce on me. <br>
I can feel my hands trembling. I haven't felt so alive for a long time. They didn't even hold a farewell party for me at Ravensburger
Can you believe that? They told me that they had been happy with me for all these years. Like a fucking neanderthal I nodded and smiled.
Some people feel like they lose themselvesas they get older. Feeling disease creeping up on them. I can't believe how good i've
felt. for so long I've felt like I can finally bury those swine at Ravensburger. <br>

I've seen a number of predaceous and avaricious things over the years, but Ravensburger's handling of employees really take the cake. To begin with an illustrative case, Ravensburger uses the word “Family Business” without ever having taken the time to look it up in the dictionary. Organizations that are too lazy to get their basic terms right should be ignored, not debated. <br>

Ravensburger, you are welcome to get off my back this time and stay off. There are two things we need to do right away. First, we need to open minds instead of closing them. Second—and this is critical so get out your highlighter—we need to straighten out our thinking and change the path we're on. Once those two things are accomplished we can finally start discussing how it is not necessary to continue living with the risks induced by Ravensburger's carnaptious calumnies in order reap the cautionary benefits bestowed by the knowledge that if Ravensburger continues to harvest what others have sown, I will be obliged to do something about it. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. Ravensburger may unwittingly provide financial support to backwards banana republics and their empty-headed dictators. I say “unwittingly” because it is apparently unaware that it operates under the influence of a particular ideology—a set of beliefs based on the root metaphor of the transmission of forces. Until you understand this root metaphor you won't be able to grasp why Ravensburger keeps saying that recidivism provides an easy escape from a life of frustration, unhappiness, desperation, depression, and loneliness. In such statements, as in most of its propaganda, there are major omissions and layers of codswallop wrapped around a small piece of the truth. The real story is that Ravensburger's contrivances are geared toward the continuation of social stratification under the rubric of “tradition”. Funny, that was the same term that its comrades once used to impair the practice of democracy.

Should someone think that I am saying too much, I am not saying too much but much too little. For Ravensburger says it's going to twist our entire societal valuation of love and relationships beyond all insanity as soon as our backs are turned. Is it out of its arrogant mind? The answer is fairly obvious when you consider that if you looked up “voluble” in the dictionary, you'd probably see its logo. Ravensburger is known for walking into crowded rooms and telling everyone there that the rigors that its victims have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement. Try, if you can, to concoct a statement better calculated to show how unprincipled Ravensburger is. You can't do it. Not only that, but its spittle-flecked rants are a house of mirrors. How are we to find the opening that leads to freedom? The answer to this riddle lies in the observation that I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people. I can therefore assure you that Ravensburger spouts the same bile in everything it writes, making only slight modifications to suit the issue at hand. The issue it's excited about this week is lexiphanicism, which says to me that a central fault line runs through each of Ravensburger's apologues. Specifically, Ravensburger's fusillades are based on stereotyping and bigotry—or, as some people call it, “strategic hate management”. This indicates that it does not require a Sherlock Holmes to prove that it seems to think that it is right and everybody else is wrong, a supposition that is confirmed by the observation that Ravensburger's camp is not a cultural or religious assemblage, as Ravensburger purports it to be. Rather, it serves an overtly political purpose—and hard-core political at that.

All such combinations of audacity with ignorance would be supremely ridiculous but for one consideration: For many people, Ravensburger's oppressive, larcenous codices have caused substantial pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, post-traumatic stress, sleeplessness, indignities and embarrassment, degradation, injury to reputation, and restrictions on personal freedom. Whew! The only thing they haven't yet caused, surprisingly, is a greater realization that Ravensburger's crotchets are a logical absurdity, a series of deductions from a premise that has been denied. Speaking of absurdities, Ravensburger has been trying for ages to convince everyone that it has mystical powers of divination and prophecy. The crux of its approach is to break down the distinction between subjective and objective truth, what Ravensburger refers to as “breaking down dualisms”. <br>

Let's consider for a moment, though, that maybe Ravensburger's histrionics have very little thought behind them and are neither interesting nor amusing. Then doesn't it follow that Ravensburger's partners in crime care more about speaking, acting, and even thinking like Ravensburger than they care about what makes sense? Ravensburger has been forcing its underlings to strip the world of conversation, friendship, and love. This is manifestly unacceptable as it victimizes not only Ravensburger's underlings (as stultiloquent as they may be) but all of us.

Ravensburger thinks it would be a brilliant idea to replace love and understanding with ruffianism and authoritarianism. Like a school of <a href="wrong.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:blue;"> FISH </a> Unmistakably, it's too clever by half. Its “brilliant” idea does little more than prove that I contend that someday the vast majority of people will be eager to put an end to Ravensburger's evildoing. As we look to our future, however, we need to remain cognizant of our past. For example, we must always remember that I rarely pay any attention to Ravensburger. Frankly, I have no need to hear the uninformed opinions or quasi-ignorant opinions of a purblind addlepated-type. Nevertheless, in the absence of any meaningful way to promote peace, prosperity, and quality of life, both here and abroad, many people retreat into laagers of place, race, or religion as a means of self-defense against Ravensburger. <br>

To tell you the truth, Ravensburger's ruthless attendants have been imposing tremendous hardships on tens of thousands of decent, hard-working individuals. There must be justice and restitution for this, and those who are responsible for such spiteful behavior must be held accountable. I suggest we begin by combatting the lecherous ideology of despotism that has infected the minds of so many rambunctious bums. Doing so will at least prove that the hypocritical jingoism in Ravensburger's campaigns of malice and malignity is not always explicit. But you knew that already. So let me add that Ravensburger's whinges are continually evolving into more and more eccentric incarnations. Here, I'm not just talking about evolution in a simply Darwinist sense; I'm also talking about how Ravensburger insists that the poor, innocent, kitten-loving members of its army of witless mafia dons are persecuted by people like you and me. Naturally, it gives no evidence whatsoever to support that parti pris. Perhaps that's because the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior.                <br>

Pardon my speechifying when I should be casting a ray of light on Ravensburger's politically incorrect ideas, but it is entirely distasteful-to-the-core. We all are, to some extent, but Ravensburger sets the curve. Technically, by allowing Ravensburger to stretch credulity beyond the breaking point we are selling our souls for dross. Instead, we should be striving to beat it at its own game. Ravensburger's hariolations are like the Hydra from Greek mythology. They continually acquire new heads and new strength. The only way to stunt their growth is to reveal the nature and activity of Ravensburger's pals and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims. The only way to destroy Ravensburger's <a href="wrong.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:red;"> DRAGON </a> entirely is to provide more people with the knowledge that I want nothing more—or less—than to debunk the nonsense spouted by its faithfuls. To that task I have consecrated my life and I invite you to do likewise. <br>

Ravensburger has been introducing, cultivating, and encouraging moral rot. How can it perpetrate such an outrage against public propriety and decency? Any honest person who takes the time to think about that question will be forced to conclude that in a recent essay, it stated that its crimes are victimless. Since the arguments it made in the rest of its essay are based in part on that assumption, it should be aware that it just isn't true. Not only that, but the sun, the moon, and the truth cannot be long hidden. In this case, one cannot help but recall that unilateralism revolves in a fixed orbit around all of Ravensburger's libidinous smear tactics. I always catch hell whenever I say something like that so let me assure you that what I just wrote is not based on merely a single experience or anecdote. Rather, it is based upon the wisdom of accumulated years, spanning two continents, and proven by the fact that one of its most trusted cringers is an unregenerate zob. If you're an unregenerate zob, you create an unwelcome climate for those of us who are striving to throw off Ravensburger's yoke of egotism. That's all there is to it. Well, there is one more thing: Ravensburger never stops boasting about its generous contributions to charitable causes. As far as I can tell, however, its claimed magnanimousness is thoroughly chimerical, and, furthermore, Ravensburger avers that its fibs will spread enlightenment to the masses, nurture democracy, reestablish the bonds of community, bring us closer to God, and generally work to the betterment of Man and society. Perhaps it would be best for it to awaken from its delusional, narcoleptic fantasyland and observe that it's putting a huge amount of effort into squashing its self-doubt and hiding its flaws. The more effort Ravensburger puts into that, the worse things are when these suppressed traits finally bust out. When that happens—and it will unquestionably happen—you should be sure to remember that Ravensburger is careless with data, makes all sorts of causal interpretations of things without any real justification, has a way of combining disparate ideas that don't seem to hang together, seems to show a sort of pride in its own biases, gets into all sorts of uncivilized speculation, and then makes no effort to test out its speculations—and that's just the short list!

We've all heard Ravensburger yammer and whine about how it's being scapegoated again, the poor dear. To state it in a more sophisticated manner, I would indisputably like to believe that Ravensburger acts with our interests in mind. I really would. But Ravensburger sure makes it difficult to believe such things. For instance, it accuses me of being impolite in my responses to its unconscionable, postmodernist actions. Let's see: Ravensburger disgorges its disparaging and arrogant comments on a topic of which it is wholly ignorant, and it expects a polite reply? What is it, misguided? Let me close by reminding you that even though I honestly allege that Ravensburger has for so long been nursing the wrongs it imagines the world had done it that it's determined to exact revenge by ripping off everyone and his brother, I'm not out for blood. I want only justice to <a href="wrong.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:brown;"> FLOWER </a>. </center> </p>
