1. You try to apologize for your inadequateness, but stop when he, smiling, raises his hand. (Forkort sætning)
2. Your master claps his hands and is gone. So is the hearth. You stand in darkness. The seal of the bird is beneath your feet. (Tilføj: and the blanket.)
3. The seal is severely torn and it seems like it can be peeled off. (Skriv sætning om)
4. "We are currently playing that game, a perverted version of it at least." ("YOU are currently...)
5. I've chosen to call this creature 'Crumbling Kenneth'. (You could call this paranoid man 'Crumbling Kenneth')
6. "The "War Room" is a webpage he created where he wants you to keep doing his psychotic research into how he has been wronged by Ravensburger. (Omformuler teksten så den lægger op til at den er et 'mad ramble')
