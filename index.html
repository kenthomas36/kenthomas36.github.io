<p> <center> Welcome to my page! If you don't know who I am (you probably don't) I hope the text below suffices. If you're still curious,
             please look at my CV. </center> </p>

<p> <center> <b> Biography </center> </b> </p>
<p> <center> I've been working on games my whole life.
             I started working at Ravensburger after I got my Master's Degree in Sociology. The people who tell you that sociology has nothing to do with game
             design don't have a clue what they're talking about. I started at Ravensburger in the early 60's, helping design the many puzzles they were manufacturing.
             Though this made the company a lot of money, it was my belief that we needed to challenge players more. Instead of letting them fill out a picture,
             we should give them playful experiences that would activate their imagination. Anything else would be a waste of time. In 1977, when the company finally split itself into
             a Books and Games division, it was under my supervision that classics like "Rabbit and Hedgehog", "Enchanted Forest" and <a href="gate.html" style="text-decoration:none;color:black;"> <i> "Master Labyrinth" </i> </a> came to be.
             Although I see all of my games as my children, it was my work at the long-forgotten Luck & Sense Games that I am most proud of.
